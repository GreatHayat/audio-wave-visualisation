# Audio Visualization

This project utilizes HTML5 canvas and JavaScript to create a real-time audio visualization that reacts to microphone input. The visualization consists of vertical bars that dynamically change height based on the audio signal's frequency data.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Bars react instantly to audio input from the microphone.
- **Dynamic Bar Height**: Each bar's height is determined by the frequency data of the audio signal.
- **Animation**: Includes animation effects when the microphone is active but the user is not speaking.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualization adapts to different screen sizes.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Simply open the any html file i.e. `index.html` file in a web browser that supports HTML5 and audio input from the microphone.

## Usage

1. Ensure your device has a microphone.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Grant permission for the browser to access your microphone.
4. Speak into the microphone and observe the bars react to your voice.
